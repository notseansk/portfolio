              Enthusiastic, self-motivated, responsible and hard-working
              individual with strong passion for web development. I consider
              myself an inovative and avid front end developer. I like creating
              websites and I mostly work on HTML, CSS and React JS. In my free
              time I like to dabble into the world of graphics designing and
              photography as well. I think that's all for my introduction, I am
              not that interesting you see.. but please let me know what you
              think about this website via the message section below. PS: Rome
              was't built in a day but this website was. Haha.... I wish.
